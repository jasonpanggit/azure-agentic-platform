# Azure Agentic Platform (AAP) — Project State

> Last updated: 2026-03-26 — Phase 1 complete (all 5 plans)

---

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Foundation — Complete (5/5 plans)**

---

## Project

**Azure Agentic Platform (AAP) — Milestone v1.0**

---

## Core Value

> Operators can understand, investigate, and resolve any Azure infrastructure issue — across all subscriptions and Arc-connected resources — through a single intelligent platform that shows its reasoning transparently and never acts without human approval.

None.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Centralized private-endpoints module | 1-01 | All PEs in one module eliminates duplication and avoids circular deps between networking and resource modules |
| PostgreSQL VNet injection over PE | 1-01 | Azure-recommended approach for Flexible Server; delegated subnet is simpler than PE |
| Interface-first module design | 1-01 | All variables.tf/outputs.tf fully defined before implementation enables parallel work in Plans 02-04 |
| No PEs in networking module | 1-02 | Centralized in modules/private-endpoints to avoid circular deps where networking needs resource IDs from dependent modules |
| Reserved subnet for Phase 4 Event Hub | 1-02 | Pre-allocate snet-reserved-1 at 10.0.64.0/24 to avoid VNet CIDR changes later |
| Foundry subnet gets own NSG | 1-02 | ISSUE-08: Foundry subnet needs inbound 443 from Container Apps for future PE traffic |
| No local-exec for pgvector on VNet-isolated PostgreSQL | 1-03 | ISSUE-04: GitHub runners can't reach VNet-injected PG; deferred to PLAN-05 CI workflow |
| ACR name uses random_string suffix | 1-03 | ISSUE-10: Azure Container Registry names must be globally unique |
| Foundry project inherits identity from parent account | 1-03 | ISSUE-09: azurerm_cognitive_account_project does not support identity block |
| Dev/staging Cosmos Serverless; prod Provisioned Autoscale | 1-04 | Cost optimization for non-prod; multi-region westus2 secondary for prod HA |
| Tiered PostgreSQL SKUs per environment | 1-04 | dev B1ms, staging B2ms, prod GP_Standard_D4s_v3 — General Purpose needed for prod workloads |
| Identical env structure, parameter-only differences | 1-04 | All envs share same provider/output/variable structure; only module parameters differ to minimize env drift |
| Tag lint via jq on tfplan.json | 1-05 | Catches both null tags and missing required keys; runs only when plan succeeds (ISSUE-05/06) |
| pgvector setup via temporary firewall rule in CI | 1-05 | ISSUE-04 resolution: GitHub runners can't reach VNet-injected PG directly; temporary firewall rule pattern with always-cleanup |
| Docker push as reusable workflow_call | 1-05 | Avoids duplication across agent image builds in Phase 2+; composable per-agent |
